# FPLDashboard
Discontinued project - free to a good home!
It creates in-memory Delphi objects from the entire publicly-available Fantasy Premier League JSON data files. It was going to be a comprehensive data analysis tool for FPL managers for the 2021/2022 season, but I won my first ever FPL league last season and lost interest in developing the app :D
